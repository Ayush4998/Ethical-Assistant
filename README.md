Ethical Decision-Making Assistant
Project Overview
The Ethical Decision-Making Assistant is an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist users in making ethical decisions. By utilizing frameworks like Utilitarianism, Deontology, and Rights-Based Ethics, this assistant processes user scenarios and provides guidance based on ethical reasoning.

The project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a decision-making model to categorize scenarios and return appropriate responses. It is built with a backend using Flask, PostgreSQL for database management, and a React-based frontend.

Key Features
Ethical Framework Integration:

Utilizes principles from Utilitarianism, Deontology, and Rights-Based Ethics.
Evaluates scenarios based on ethical standards and provides a categorized decision (e.g., Ethical or Unethical).
NLP-Powered Chatbot:

Processes user inputs using SpaCy for Natural Language Understanding (NLU).
Classifies scenarios using a trained Decision Tree Model.
Node-Based Conversation Flow:

Node 0: Welcome message and initial scenario request.
Node 1: Requests more information if the scenario is unclear.
Node 2: Delivers ethical reasoning if sufficient details are provided.
Database Logging and Feedback:

Tracks user interactions, decisions made, and allows feedback.
Tech Stack
Backend:
Flask for handling API requests.
PostgreSQL for database management.
SpaCy for NLP integration.
Joblib for loading the trained decision tree model.
Frontend:
React framework.
Material-UI (MUI) for UI components.
Database:
SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions.
Database Schema
The following tables form the backbone of the application:

Users Table:

user_id: Unique identifier for the user.
username, email: Basic user details.
created_at: Timestamp when the user registered.
Ethical Decisions Table:

decision_id: Unique identifier for each decision made.
user_id: Foreign key linked to the users table.
scenario, decision, ethical_framework: Details about the decision and the scenario evaluated.
created_at: Timestamp when the decision was logged.
Interactions Table:

interaction_id: Tracks individual chatbot interactions.
user_message, bot_response: Logs each message sent and received.
Feedback Table:

feedback_id: Logs user feedback on decisions.
user_id, decision_id: Foreign keys.
feedback_text, rating: User feedback and ratings.
Logs Table:

log_id: Logs system events such as errors or important actions.
